# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Flight delays cause inconvenience to passengers and financial loss to airlines.  
This project focuses on predicting whether a flight will be delayed or not using historical flight operation data and machine learning algorithms.

The model helps identify key delay factors and supports better decision-making in the aviation industry.

## Objectives
- Predict flight delays using past flight data  
- Analyze major factors contributing to delays  
- Build and evaluate machine learning classification models  
- Improve airline scheduling and passenger experience  

## Technologies Used
